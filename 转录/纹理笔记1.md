## Minecraft Organic Texturing Notes

**General Principles:**

*   **Texture = Form + Color:** Both the underlying shape of the build and the colors used are equally important for effective texturing.
*   **Scale Matters:** The scale of your build influences how much detail you can achieve with form versus color.
    *   **Smaller Builds:** Often require smoother forms, relying more on color placement and special blocks (like glass) for detail.
    *   **Larger Builds:** Allow for more intricate form detailing (e.g., carved shapes) in addition to color.
*   **Practice & Observation:** Developing an "eye" for highlights, shadows, and natural patterns comes with practice and observing real-world references.
*   **Trial and Error:** Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust.

### **GoPaint (Plugin/Tool)**

*   **Access:** The video shows a menu titled "goPaint Menu." (Implied command: `/gopaint` or similar, though not explicitly typed).
*   **Brush Types Shown:**
    *   Sphere Brush (used most often)
    *   Spray Brush
    *   Disc Brush
    *   Bucket Brush
    *   Angle Brush
    *   Overlay Brush
    *   Fracture Brush
    *   Paint Brush
*   **Brush Size Control:**
    *   Left-click to increase
    *   Right-click to decrease
    *   Shift-click to change by 10
*   **Falloff Strength:** Adjustable setting (e.g., `Falloff Strength: 80%` shown). Influences how quickly the brush effect fades.
*   **Masks:** Can be enabled/disabled (Jack-o'-lantern icon shown as "Mask Enabled").
*   **Usage:** Primarily for quickly applying and blending colors over large areas.

### **Other Building Tools**

*   **Loft Tool (`/br sphere loft`):**
    *   **Usage:** Used to create smooth, curved shapes between defined "frames" (points in space).
    *   **Process:** Define a series of cross-sections or points, then "loft" the shape between them.
    *   **Application:** Demonstrated for building the basic structure of a wing. More effective for larger-scale organic forms where smooth curves are desired.
*   **Replace Brush (`/repl`):**
    *   **Usage:** Used to quickly change existing blocks to a different type.
    *   **Command Example:** `/repl <block_to_replace> <new_block>` (e.g., `/repl red_wool red_concrete`).
    *   **Benefit:** Ideal for fine-tuning color palettes or correcting mistakes without rebuilding.
*   **Lighten Brush (`/br sphere lighten`):**
    *   **Usage:** Randomly replaces blocks within a brush area with lighter variants from your palette.
    *   **Benefit:** Creates natural-looking variations and highlights, especially useful for textures like feathers or scales.
    *   **Refinement:** Often requires manual cleanup afterward to ensure desired block placement.

### **Texturing Techniques by Type**

#### **1. Fur (Wolf Example)**

*   **Form:** For smaller-scale fur (like the wolf shown), keep the underlying form very smooth. Avoid excessive bumps or jaggedness, as it might look messy at a distance.
*   **Color Palette:** Use multiple shades of the fur's primary color (e.g., grays) along with accent colors (e.g., browns, creams).
*   **Initial Application:** Lay down base colors, blending them roughly onto the smooth form. Don't aim for perfection at this stage.
*   **Adding Volume/Softness (Special Technique):**
    *   Use **stained glass panes** (or other transparent blocks) strategically.
    *   Place them along edges or where fur would naturally "stick out" to soften the hard block edges.
    *   This creates an illusion of depth and fluffiness without adding complex block geometry.
    *   **Crucially, do *not* place glass everywhere**, as it will cover other colors and flatten the texture. Place it selectively for emphasis.
*   **Fine-tuning:** Manually adjust individual blocks for a more natural, "speckled" look, ensuring colors blend well.

#### **2. Feathers (Owl Example)**

*   **Form is Paramount:** Feathers *must* be defined by the underlying form. They should look like feathers *before* any color is applied.
*   **Wing Structure:**
    1.  Build the main "bone structure" or overall shape of the wing (Loft tool is useful for this).
    2.  Then, build out individual feathers, paying attention to their overlap and direction. This is often a meticulous, block-by-block process.
    3.  Ensure wings have volume and don't look like flat sheets.
*   **Color Palette:** Use multiple shades of white and gray (e.g., white wool, light gray wool, polished diorite, calcite, smooth stone, blackstone).
*   **Color Application:**
    1.  Place darker blocks in areas that would naturally be shadowed (e.g., undersides, crevices between feathers).
    2.  Place lighter blocks (highlights) on exposed areas.
    3.  The inherent shape of the feathers will create natural shadows and highlights, which the colors then reinforce.
    4.  Use the **Lighten Brush** to randomly introduce lighter blocks for a natural, varied look, then manually clean up for precision.
*   **Overall Look:** Aim for a gradient of shades that flows naturally across the wing, emphasizing the feather shapes.

#### **3. Scales (Dragon Example)**

*   **Form:**
    *   For smaller scales, a smooth underlying form is acceptable.
    *   For larger scales or areas like the belly, carving "ridges" or defining individual scale shapes into the form adds significant depth.
*   **Color Palette:** Use a gradient of colors for the main body (e.g., dark reds, medium reds, bright reds) and a separate palette for the belly (e.g., browns).
*   **Individual Scale Texturing:**
    1.  **Outline:** Start by outlining the shape of individual scales with a darker color (e.g., Crimson Hyphae).
    2.  **Fill & Gradient:** Fill in the scales with a medium color (e.g., Red Concrete).
    3.  **Highlights/Shadows:** Add lighter blocks (e.g., Red Wool, Red Glazed Terracotta) to the exposed parts of each scale and darker blocks (e.g., Red Nether Bricks, Nether Wart Block) to the shadowed parts.
    4.  **Variety:** Don't texture every scale identically. Vary the number and placement of highlight/shadow blocks on each scale to avoid repetition.
*   **Overall Body Texturing (Macro-level):**
    1.  **Gradient of Scales:** Create a larger gradient across the dragon's body, where scales in certain areas are generally darker (e.g., underside, crevices) and others are brighter (e.g., back, exposed areas).
    2.  **Blending:** Ensure a smooth transition between different colored scale sections.
    3.  **Special Blocks:** Use blocks with unique textures (like Nether Wart Block or Glazed Terracotta) sparingly within the scales to add visual interest and break up monotony.
*   **Wing Texturing (Dragon):**
    1.  Start with a base color (e.g., Polished Blackstone).
    2.  Use the **Lighten Brush** to randomly introduce lighter blocks (e.g., various grays, ores).
    3.  Manually clean up the randomized blocks, removing unwanted ones and refining the blend.
    4.  Add distinct darker streaks (e.g., Red Nether Bricks) to emphasize the bone structure or membrane folds.

**Bonus Tips:**

*   **Eyes:** Use different bright blocks (e.g., gold blocks, yellow concrete) for the iris and pupil, then cover with glass for a glazed, reflective look.
*   **Belly (Dragon):** Carve out distinct ridges and use a separate brown color palette to create a gradient from dark to light, emphasizing the shape.
*   **Horns/Spikes:** Use lighter colors (e.g., bone blocks, quartz) and ensure they stand out from the main body color.
*   **Patience is Key:** Complex organic builds take a lot of time and dedication.
